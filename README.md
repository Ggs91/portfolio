# Portfolio

Static website portfolio that I've created from scratch to showcase my work. 

You can visit my portfolio here: [www.georgesatalla.com](https://www.georgesatalla.com/)

I've used pure HTML / SCSS / vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks, no libraries.
Build tool: webpack.

I've created a parallax effect for the hero section, I used CSS animations for the menu toggle, and IntersectionObserver API for the scroll effects.

I had a lot of fun doing it !
